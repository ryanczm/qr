This is a repo for quant analysis/data analysis projects in finance. I am still learning, so bear with me.

* `pairs_trading_nasdaq.ipynb` - This notebook comes from the project I did on my [website](https://ryan-chew.com/quant_pairs_trade.html), which details implementing, backtesting and evaluating a simple pairs trading strategy on NASDAQ 100 equities. However, the main takeaway is that only using in-sample cointegration gives poor predictions of out-sample cointegration, and so another approach would be to research to identify features (e.g event based, macro based, etc) to predict lookahead cointegration of pairs, then trade cointegrated pairs.
